Currently, I have two packages on CRAN
 
 - [`vagalumeR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vagalumeR/vagalumeR.pdf) 
 - [`chorrrds`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chorrrds/chorrrds.pdf)

They have the same subject: music data. `vagalumeR` is the package that
extracts music lyrics from the [Vagalume](https://www.vagalume.com.br/)
API. The second package, `chorrrds`, extracts music chords from the [CifraClub](https://www.cifraclub.com.br/) website, through web scraping.

Both these packages are in constantly development, are their most recent
ones will be always available first at [my github](https://github.com/brunaw).
