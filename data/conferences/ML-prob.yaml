  A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses 
  probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. 
  Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated 
  methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, 
  developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in 
  data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. 
  This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction 
  to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, 
  probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, 
  offering necessary background material on such topics as probability,
  optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments 
  in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, 
  and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, 
  accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important
  algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images 
  and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, 
  text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a 
  cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a 
  principled model-based approach, often using the language of 
  graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way.
  Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB 
  software package-PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)-that is 
  freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level 
  undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background 
  and beginning graduate students.
