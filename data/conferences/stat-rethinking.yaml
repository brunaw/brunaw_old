  Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in 
  making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting 
  in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform
  step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique 
  computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the
  details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own
  modeling work.
