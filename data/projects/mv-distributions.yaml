  Our main goal is to propose multivariate models for non Gaussian
  data. The method employed involves quadratic forms based on 
  deviance residuals, similarly to the multivariate Gaussian 
  distribution. Between the results, we have the assimilation 
  of the behaviour of the distributions in relation to its 
  parameters and the computational implementation.
