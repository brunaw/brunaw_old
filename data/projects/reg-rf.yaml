  We generalise the approach of Deng & Runger(2012), which relies on 
  gain penalisation for fea-ture selection in Random Forests. We show 
  that previous methods do not perform sufficient regularization and 
  often exhibit sub-optimal out-of-sample performance, especially when
  correlatedfeatures are present. Instead, we extend the gain
  penalisation idea to a general local-global regularization for
  tree-based models, that allows formore flexibility in the choice 
  of feature-specific importance weights.
