  As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to 
  achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, 
  inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently 
  underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, 
  therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to 
  achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative 
  global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers 
  to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.
