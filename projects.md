<h2>Projects</h2>

This is the session where you're going to find information about 
my projects.

As as I am very interested in Music Information Retrieval, I 
developed, so far, two packages for R: [vagalumeR](https://github.com/brunaw/vagalumeR), which is about
lyrics data extraction, and
[chorrrds](https://github.com/brunaw/chorrrds), a package that
extracts music chords from the 
[CifraClub](https://www.cifraclub.com.br/) website. They're both
already available on CRAN. I also have 
worked on the R package that makes connections with the 
[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) (found [at this repository](https://github.com/tiagomendesdantas/Rspotify)).

Some of my work with Shiny Applications, and the `flexdashboard`,
package can be found [here](https://github.com/brunaw/catreg)
and [here](https://github.com/brunaw/dissertacao-francimario). The
first one is about my non-linear models catalog, which is still in
development. The second is for the ones who are interested in 
probability distributions in the unit interval, as it is a catalog
on this subject. 

My most recent projects envolve mostly probability theory and 
distributions. If you're interested in Multivariate 
Probability Distributions, take a look
[here](https://github.com/brunaw/mvdist). I'm also
writing a material on probability exercises, which is 
available at 
[this repository](https://github.com/brunaw/prob_exercises). 
And last on this topic, 
but not less important, we have my studies on
Probabilistic Graphical Models, found at this 
[link](https://github.com/brunaw/pgm).
