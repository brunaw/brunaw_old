      <description>Targeting core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a key treatment goal for parents of children with ASD. While many efficacious treatments for ASD have been developed, a major obstacle in evaluating these treatments among children with ASD has been the lack of adequate outcome measures (Anagnostou et al., 2014; Bolte &amp;amp; Diehl, 2013; Kanne et al., 2014). Most treatment studies have relied on informant-based measures (i.e., parent or clinician report) that either place a high burden on families, or require significant training and time to administer.</description>

      <description>Statistical concepts are not always easy to absorb. Many students remain without fully understanding them, even after spending a good time studying the subject. Sometimes, this can be due to the level of abstraction needed to perceive the behavior of mathematical functions. With this in mind, this project has as one of its main goals to provide a set of interactive applications to help with both teaching and learning of statistics.</description>
