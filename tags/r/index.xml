      <description>*Portuguese version of this same post here!
On a daily basis, I come across people on Facebook groups, Telegram or Twitter having troubles with some tasks in R. These problems have two main origins:
difficulties in constructing the algorithm to reach the desired result. difficulties in understanding the behavior of some function.  The focus of this post is to give some notion about how to solve the second one: problems using functions.</description>

      <description>The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users (see recent stats).
As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community.</description>

      <description>Targeting core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a key treatment goal for parents of children with ASD. While many efficacious treatments for ASD have been developed, a major obstacle in evaluating these treatments among children with ASD has been the lack of adequate outcome measures (Anagnostou et al., 2014; Bolte &amp;amp; Diehl, 2013; Kanne et al., 2014). Most treatment studies have relied on informant-based measures (i.e., parent or clinician report) that either place a high burden on families, or require significant training and time to administer.</description>

      <description>Statistical concepts are not always easy to absorb. Many students remain without fully understanding them, even after spending a good time studying the subject. Sometimes, this can be due to the level of abstraction needed to perceive the behavior of mathematical functions. With this in mind, this project has as one of its main goals to provide a set of interactive applications to help with both teaching and learning of statistics.</description>
